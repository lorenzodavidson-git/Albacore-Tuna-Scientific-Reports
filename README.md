# Albacore-Tuna-Scientific-Reports
GitHub repository for data and Matlab code pertaining to the Nature Scientific Reports submission titled “An Individual-based Model of North Pacific Albacore Tuna Seasonal Migratory Behaviour and Climate Sensitivity”

The main Matlab scripts to process the data and create the figures are named FISH_Process_Final.m and FISH_Figures_Final.m, respectively. These scripts utilize functions that can be found in the folders named "util" and "code". 
Running the FISH_Process_Final.m creates new files that are used by the FISH_Figures_Final.m to visualize the data. 

The data can be downloaded from the following Google Drive link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MfaCP5jm_Ia_hE9FtYLEHkTl2KBfcf6N?usp=drive_link. Access to the albacore tuna data found in the "fish_data" folder must be requested to lorenzo_davidson@alumni.brown.edu.

For any questions please reach out to lorenzo_davidson@alumni.brown.edu
